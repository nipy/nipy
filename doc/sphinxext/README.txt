===================
 Sphinx Extensions
===================

Thesea are a few sphinx extensions we are using to build the nipy
documentation.  In this file we list where they each come from, since we intend
to always push back upstream any modifications or improvements we make to them.

* From matploltlib:
  * inheritance_diagram.py

* From numpy:
  * numpy_ext

* From ipython
  * ipython_console_highlighting

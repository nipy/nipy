 Nipy roadmap
==============

We plan to release a protoype of NIPY_ by the Summer of 2009.  This
will include a full FMRI analysis, 2D visualization, and integration
with other packages for spatial processing (SPM_ and FSL_).  We will
continue to improve our documentation and tutorials with the aim of
providing a full introduction to neuroimaging analysis.

We will also extend our collaborations with other neuroimaging groups,
integrating more functionality into NIPY and providing better
interoperability with other packages.  This will include the design
and implementation of a pipeline/batching system, integration of
registration algorithms, and improved 2D and 3D visualization.

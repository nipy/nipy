 Introduction
==============

As you can see, we do not yet have much of a user guide for NIPY.  We
are spending all our effort in developing the building blocks of the
code, and we have not yet returned to a guide to how to use it.

We are starting to write general :ref:`tutorial-index`, that include
introductions to how to use NIPY code to run analyses.

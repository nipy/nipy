===================
 A history of NIPY
===================

Sometime around 2002, Jonthan Taylor started writing BrainSTAT, a
Python version of Keith Worsley's FmriSTAT package.

In 2004, Jarrod Millman and Matthew Brett decided that they wanted to
write a grant to build a new neuoimaging analysis package in Python.
Soon afterwards, they found that Jonathan had already started, and
merged efforts.  At first we called this project *BrainPy*.  Later we
changed the name to NIPY.

In 2005, Jarrod, Matthew and Jonathan, along with Mark D'Esposito,
Fernando Perez, John Hunter, Jean-Baptiste Poline, and Tom Nichols,
submitted the first NIPY grant to the NIH.  It was not successful.

In 2006, Jarrod and Mark submitted a second grant, based on the first.
The NIH gave us 3 years of funding for two programmers.  We hired two
programmers in 2007 - Christopher Burns and Tom Waite - and began work on
refactoring the code.

Meanwhile, the team at Neurospin, Paris, started to refactor their FFF
code to work better with python and NIPY.  This work was by Alexis
Roche, Bertrand Thirion, and Benjamin Thyreau, with some help and
advice from Fernando Perez.

In 2008, Fernando Perez and Matthew Brett started work full-time at
the UC Berkeley `Brain Imaging Center <http://bic.berkeley.edu/>`_.
Matthew in particular came to work on NIPY.

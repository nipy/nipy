I extracted these basal ganglia definitions from the MNI
ICBM 2009c Nonlinear Symmetric template at 1Ã—1x1 mm resolution.

At the time, the templates were available here:

http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/ServicesAtlases/ICBM152NLin2009

The script to extract the data was::

    from os.path import join as pjoin
    import numpy as np

    import nibabel as nib

    atlas_fname = pjoin('mni_icbm152_nlin_sym_09c',
                        'mni_icbm152_t1_tal_nlin_sym_09a_atlas',
                        'AtlasGrey.mnc')
    atlas_img = nib.load(atlas_fname)
    # Data is in fact uint8, but with trivial float scaling
    data = atlas_img.get_data().astype(np.uint8)
    bg_data = np.zeros_like(data)
    for code in (14, 16, 39, 53): # LR striatum, LR caudate
        in_mask = data == code
        bg_data[in_mask] = code
    bg_img = nib.Nifti1Image(bg_data, atlas_img.affine)
    bg_img = nib.as_closest_canonical(bg_img)
    nib.save(bg_img, 'basal_ganglia.nii.gz')

Data codes

These are the values in the image:

* 14 - Left striatum
* 16 - Right striatum
* 39 - Left caudate
* 53 - Right caudate

Everything else is zero.

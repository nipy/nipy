 Development quickstart
========================

Source Code
===========

NIPY uses github_ for our code hosting.  For immediate access to
the source code, see the `nipy github`_ site.

Checking out the latest version
===============================

To check out the latest version of nipy you need git_::

    git clone git://github.com/nipy/nipy.git

There are two methods to install a development version of nipy.  For
both methods, build the extensions in place::

    python setup.py build_ext --inplace

Then you can either:

#. Create a symbolic link in your *site-packages* directory to the inplace
   build of your source.  The advantage of this method is it does not require
   any modifications of your PYTHONPATH.

#. Place the source directory in your PYTHONPATH.

With either method, all of the modifications made to your source tree
will be picked up when nipy is imported.

Getting data files
==================

See :ref:`data_files`.

Guidelines
==========

We have adopted many developer guidelines in an effort to make
development easy, and the source code readable, consistent and robust.
Many of our guidelines are adopted from the scipy_ / numpy_ community.
We welcome new developers to the effort, if you're interested in
developing code or documentation please join the `nipy mailing list`_
and introduce yourself.  If you plan to do any code development, we
ask that you take a look at the following guidelines.  We do our best
to follow these guidelines ourselves:

* :ref:`howto_document` : Documentation is critical.  This document
  describes the documentation style, syntax, and tools we use.

* `Numpy/Scipy Coding Style Guidelines:
  <http://projects.scipy.org/scipy/numpy/wiki/CodingStyleGuidelines>`_
  This is the coding style we strive to maintain.

* :ref:`development-workflow` : This describes our process for version control.

* :ref:`testing` : We've adopted a rigorous testing framework.

* :ref:`optimization`: "premature optimization is the root of all
  evil."

Submitting a patch
==================

The preferred method to submit a patch is to create a branch of nipy on
your machine, modify the code and make a patch or patches.  Then email
the `nipy mailing list`_ and we will review your code and hopefully
apply (merge) your patch.  See the instructions for
:ref:`making-patches`.

If you do not wish to use git and github, please feel free to
file a bug report and submit a patch or email the
`nipy mailing list`_.

Bug reports
===========

If you find a bug in nipy, please submit a bug report at the `nipy
bugs`_ github site so that we can fix it.

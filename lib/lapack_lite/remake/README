The C code in the parent directory was generated from the LAPACK-3-1-1
sources from netlib (http://www.netlib.org/lapack/) as follows: 

** We copied the following files from numpy-trunk/numpy/linalg/lapack_lite/
(numpy version '1.0.5.dev4854'): 

make_lite.py 
f2c.h
f2c_lite.c
dlamch.c

We modified make_lite.py to fix a syntax error (missing colon) and
replace include "Numeric/f2c.h" with "f2c.h". 

We modified f2c_lite.c to add the definition of d_nint(). 

** We used the python package Plex, version 1.1.5, as found on: 
http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/~greg/python/Plex/

** We ran: 
python ./make_lite.py wrapped_routines.txt $LAPACK new-lite/ 

and kept both: blas_lite.c and dlapack_lite.c (the fff library doesn't
use complex types in the core C routines, so zlapack_lite.c is
useless).

** We modified one line in the generated dlapack_lite.c (41272) as the 
iparmq_ function was improperly called.

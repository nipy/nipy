Neuroimaging tools for Python

The aim of NIPY is to produce a platform-independent Python environment for
the analysis of brain imaging data using an open development model.

The project is still in its initial stages, but we have packages for file I/O,
script support as well as single subject fMRI and random effects group
comparisons models.

In NIPY we aim to:

   1. Provide an open source, mixed language scientific programming
      environment suitable for rapid development.

   2. Create sofware components in this environment to make it easy
      to develop tools for MRI, EEG, PET and other modalities.

   3. Create and maintain a wide base of developers to contribute to
      this platform.

   4. To maintain and develop this framework as a single, easily
      installable bundle.

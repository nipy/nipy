''' Time series diagnostics

These started life as ``tsdiffana.m`` - see
http://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/imaging/DataDiagnostics

Oliver Josephs (FIL) gave me (MB) the idea of time-point to time-point
subtraction as a diagnostic for motion and other sudden image changes.

def time_slice_diffs(arr, time_axis=-1, slice_axis=None):
    ''' Time-point to time-point differences over volumes and slices

    We think of the passed array as an image.  The image has a "time"
    dimension given by `time_axis` and a "slice" dimension, given by
    `slice_axis`, and one or more other dimensions.  In the case of imaging
    there will usually be two more dimensions (the dimensions defining the size
    of an image slice). A single slice in the time dimension we call a "volume".
    A single entry in `arr` is a "voxel".  For example, if `time_axis` == 0,
    then ``v = arr[0]`` would be the first volume in the series.  The volume
    ``v`` above has ``v.size`` voxels.  If, in addition, `slice_axis` == 1, then
    for the volume ``v`` (above) ``s = v[0]`` would be a "slice", with
    ``s.size`` voxels. These are obviously terms from neuroimaging.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : array_like
       Array over which to calculate time and slice differences.  We'll
       call this array an 'image' in this doc.
    time_axis : int optional
       axis of `arr` that varies over time. Default is last
    slice_axis : None or int, optional
       axis of `arr` that varies over image slice.  None gives last non-time
       axis.

    Returns
    -------
    results : dict

        Here ``T`` is the number of time points
        (``arr.shape[time_axis]``) and ``S`` is the number of slices
        (``arr.shape[slice_axis]``), ``v`` is the shape of a volume, and
        ``d2[t]`` is the volume of squared differences between voxels at
        time point ``t`` and time point ``t+1``

        `results` has keys:

        * 'volume_mean_diff2' : (T-1,) array
           array containing the mean (over voxels in volume) of the
           squared difference from one time point to the next
        * 'slice_mean_diff2' : (T-1, S) array
           giving the mean (over voxels in slice) of the difference from
           one time point to the next, one value per slice, per
           timepoint
        * 'volume_means' : (T,) array
           mean over voxels for each volume ``vol[t] for t in 0:T
        * 'slice_diff2_max_vol' : v[:] array
           volume, of same shape as input volumes, where each slice is
           is the slice from ``d2[t]`` for t in 0:T-1, that has the
           largest variance across ``t``.  Thus each slice in the volume
           may well result from a different difference time point.
        * 'diff2_mean_vol`` : v[:] array
           volume with the mean of ``d2[t]`` across t for t in 0:T-1.

NIPY
====

Neuroimaging tools for Python.

The aim of NIPY is to produce a platform-independent Python environment for
the analysis of functional brain imaging data using an open development model.

In NIPY we aim to:

1. Provide an open source, mixed language scientific programming environment
   suitable for rapid development.

2. Create software components in this environment to make it easy to develop
   tools for MRI, EEG, PET and other modalities.

3. Create and maintain a wide base of developers to contribute to this
   platform.

4. To maintain and develop this framework as a single, easily installable
   bundle.

NIPY is the work of many people. We list the main authors in the file
``AUTHOR`` in the NIPY distribution, and other contributions in ``THANKS``.

NIPY
====

Neuroimaging tools for Python.

The aim of NIPY is to produce a platform-independent Python environment for
the analysis of functional brain imaging data using an open development model.

In NIPY we aim to:

1. Provide an open source, mixed language scientific programming environment
   suitable for rapid development.

2. Create software components in this environment to make it easy to develop
   tools for MRI, EEG, PET and other modalities.

3. Create and maintain a wide base of developers to contribute to this
   platform.

4. To maintain and develop this framework as a single, easily installable
   bundle.

NIPY is the work of many people. We list the main authors in the file
``AUTHOR`` in the NIPY distribution, and other contributions in ``THANKS``.

Tests
=====

To run nipy's tests, you will need to install the nose_ Python testing
package.  If you are using Python 2.7, you will also need to install the mock_
testing package - e.g.::

    pip install nose mock

Then::

    python -c "import nipy; nipy.test()"

You can also run nipy's tests with the ``nipnost`` script in the ``tools``
directory of the nipy distribution::

    ./tools/nipnost nipy

``nipnost`` is a thin wrapper around the standard ``nosetests`` program that
is part of the nose package.  Try ``nipnost --help`` to see a large number of
command-line options.

Installation

Neuroimaging tools for Python.

The aim of NIPY is to produce a platform-independent Python environment for the
analysis of functional brain imaging data using an open development model.

In NIPY we aim to:

1. Provide an open source, mixed language scientific programming
    environment suitable for rapid development.

2. Create sofware components in this environment to make it easy
    to develop tools for MRI, EEG, PET and other modalities.

3. Create and maintain a wide base of developers to contribute to
    this platform.

4. To maintain and develop this framework as a single, easily
    installable bundle.

NIPY is the work of many people. We list the main authors in the file ``AUTHOR``
in the NIPY distribution, and other contributions in ``THANKS``.
